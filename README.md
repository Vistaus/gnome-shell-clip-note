# gnome-shell-clip-note

- Save clip contents to multiple notes with separate tags.
- Notes locate at ~/.local/share/clip-note/. *You can soft link this directory to anywhere as you wish.*
- Dots in filename means splited tags.
- I wonder if file operations such as *new / open / rename / delete / refresh* should be done by my extension, although I put all the icons in the software interface.
